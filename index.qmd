# Welcome! {.unnumbered}

You've discovered the work-in-progress revision for "Learning Statistics with R". 

I'm so sorry.

Perhaps I should explain. Back in the grimdark pre-Snapchat era of humanity (i.e. early 2011), I started teaching an introductory statistics class for psychology students offered at the University of Adelaide, using the R statistical package as the primary tool. I wrote my own lecture notes for the class, which have now expanded to the point of effectively being a book. The book is freely available, and released under a creative commons licence (CC BY-SA 4.0). Somehow the book turned out to be rather popular and there are now several variations of the original LSR book:

- My original book was written in LaTeX, which makes it a little inaccessible. [Emily Kothe](https://twitter.com/emilyandthelime) kindly created a [bookdown adaptation](./book/) of LSR, which I'm now reworking in quarto
- [Matt Crump](https://www.crumplab.com/) has incorporated some LSR content in [Answering Questions with Data](https://crumplab.github.io/statistics/)
- My own R programming notes [R for Psychological Science](https://psyr.djnavarro.net/) adapt some LSR content
- [David Foxcroft](https://twitter.com/davidfoxcroft) has adapted LSR to create [Learning Statistics with Jamovi](https://sites.google.com/brookes.ac.uk/learning-stats-with-jamovi)
- [Tom Faulkenberry](https://twitter.com/tomfaulkenberry) has adapted David Foxcroft's version to create [Learning Statistics with JASP](http://learnstatswithjasp.com/)
- Jean-Marc Meunier has translated *Learning Statistics with Jamovi* into [French](https://jmeunierp8.github.io/ManuelJamovi/) 
- [Ethan Weed](https://ethanweed.github.io/) has started work on a [Learning Statistics with Python](https://ethanweed.github.io/pythonbook/) adaptation (this is a work in progress!)
- [RÃ³bert Fodor](https://github.com/robertfodor/) is working on [Learning Statistics with Cogstat](https://learningstatisticswithcogstat.com/)

I have suggested that someone write a *Learning Statistics with an Abacus* adaptation but so far there has been little interest.
