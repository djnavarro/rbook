<p>In <a href="commands.html"><span>Chapter&nbsp;3</span></a> our main goal was to get started in R. As we go through the book we’ll run into a lot of new R concepts, which I’ll explain alongside the relevant data analysis concepts. However, there’s still quite a few things that I need to talk about now, otherwise we’ll run into problems when we start trying to work with data and do statistics. So that’s the goal in this chapter: to build on the introductory content from the last chapter, to get you to the point that we can start using R for statistics. Broadly speaking, the chapter comes in two parts. The first half of the chapter is devoted to the “mechanics” of R: installing and loading packages, managing the workspace, navigating the file system, and loading and saving data. In the second half, I’ll talk more about what kinds of variables exist in R, and introduce three new kinds of variables: factors, data frames and formulas. I’ll finish up by talking a little bit about the help documentation in R as well as some other avenues for finding assistance. In general, I’m not trying to be comprehensive in this chapter, I’m trying to make sure that you’ve got the basic foundations needed to tackle the content that comes later in the book. However, a lot of the topics are revisited in more detail later, especially in Chapters @ref(datahandling) and @ref(scripting).</p>
<section id="packageinstall" class="level2" data-number="6.1">
<h2 data-number="6.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="packageinstall"><span class="header-section-number">6.1</span> Installing and loading packages</h2>
<p>In this section I discuss R <strong><em>packages</em></strong>, since almost all of the functions you might want to use in R come in packages. A package is basically just a big collection of functions, data sets and other R objects that are all grouped together under a common name. Some packages are already installed when you put R on your computer, but the vast majority of them of R packages are out there on the internet, waiting for you to download, install and use them.</p>
<p>When I first started writing this book, RStudio didn’t really exist as a viable option for using R, and as a consequence I wrote a very lengthy section that explained how to do package management using raw R commands. It’s not actually terribly hard to work with packages that way, but it’s clunky and unpleasant. Fortunately, we don’t have to do things that way anymore. In this section, I’ll describe how to work with packages using the RStudio tools, because they’re so much simpler. Along the way, you’ll see that whenever you get RStudio to do something (e.g., install a package), you’ll actually see the R commands that get created. I’ll explain them as we go, because I think that helps you understand what’s going on.</p>
<p>However, before we get started, there’s a critical distinction that you need to understand, which is the difference between having a package <strong><em>installed</em></strong> on your computer, and having a package <strong><em>loaded</em></strong> in R. As of this writing, there are just over 5000 R packages freely available “out there” on the internet.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> When you install R on your computer, you don’t get all of them: only about 30 or so come bundled with the basic R installation. So right now there are about 30 packages “installed” on your computer, and another 5000 or so that are not installed. So that’s what installed means: it means “it’s on your computer somewhere”. The critical thing to remember is that just because something is on your computer doesn’t mean R can use it. In order for R to be able to <em>use</em> one of your 30 or so installed packages, that package must also be “loaded”. Generally, when you open up R, only a few of these packages (about 7 or 8) are actually loaded. Basically what it boils down to is this:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>A package must be installed before it can be loaded.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>A package must be loaded before it can be used.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This two step process might seem a little odd at first, but the designers of R had very good reasons to do it this way,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> and you get the hang of it pretty quickly.</p>
<section id="the-package-panel-in-rstudio" class="level3" data-number="6.1.1">
<h3 data-number="6.1.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-package-panel-in-rstudio"><span class="header-section-number">6.1.1</span> The package panel in RStudio</h3>
<div class="cell">

</div>
<p>Right, lets get started. The first thing you need to do is look in the lower right hand panel in RStudio. You’ll see a tab labelled “Packages”. Click on the tab, and you’ll see a list of packages that looks something like Figure @ref(fig:packagepanel). Every row in the panel corresponds to a different package, and every column is a useful piece of information about that package.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> Going from left to right, here’s what each column is telling you:</p>
<ul>
<li>The check box on the far left column indicates whether or not the package is loaded.</li>
<li>The one word of text immediately to the right of the check box is the name of the package.</li>
<li>The short passage of text next to the name is a brief description of the package.</li>
<li>The number next to the description tells you what version of the package you have installed.</li>
<li>The little x-mark next to the version number is a button that you can push to uninstall the package from your computer (you almost never need this).</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="packageload" class="level3" data-number="6.1.2">
<h3 data-number="6.1.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="packageload"><span class="header-section-number">6.1.2</span> Loading a package</h3>
<p>That seems straightforward enough, so let’s try loading and unloading packades. For this example, I’ll use the <code>foreign</code> package. The <code>foreign</code> package is a collection of tools that are very handy when R needs to interact with files that are produced by other software packages (e.g., SPSS). It comes bundled with R, so it’s one of the ones that you have installed already, but it won’t be one of the ones loaded. Inside the <code>foreign</code> package is a function called <code>read.spss()</code>. It’s a handy little function that you can use to import an SPSS data file into R, so let’s pretend we want to use it. Currently, the <code>foreign</code> package isn’t loaded, so if I ask R to tell me if it knows about a function called <code>read.spss()</code> it tells me that there’s no such thing…</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">exists</span>( <span class="st">"read.spss"</span> )</span></code><button title="Copy to Clipboard" class="code-copy-button"><i class="bi"></i></button></pre></div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>[1] FALSE</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Now let’s load the package. In RStudio, the process is dead simple: go to the package tab, find the entry for the <code>foreign</code> package, and check the box on the left hand side. The moment that you do this, you’ll see a command like this appear in the R console:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">library</span>(<span class="st">"foreign"</span>, <span class="at">lib.loc=</span><span class="st">"/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.0/Resources/library"</span>)</span></code><button title="Copy to Clipboard" class="code-copy-button"><i class="bi"></i></button></pre></div>
</div>
<p>The <code>lib.loc</code> bit will look slightly different on Macs versus on Windows, because that part of the command is just RStudio telling R where to look to find the installed packages. What I’ve shown you above is the Mac version. On a Windows machine, you’ll probably see something that looks like this:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb4"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">library</span>(<span class="st">"foreign"</span>, <span class="at">lib.loc=</span><span class="st">"C:/Program Files/R/R-3.0.2/library"</span>)</span></code><button title="Copy to Clipboard" class="code-copy-button"><i class="bi"></i></button></pre></div>
</div>
<p>But actually it doesn’t matter much. The <code>lib.loc</code> bit is almost always unnecessary. Unless you’ve taken to installing packages in idiosyncratic places (which is something that you can do if you really want) R already knows where to look. So in the vast majority of cases, the command to load the <code>foreign</code> package is just this:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb5"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">library</span>(<span class="st">"foreign"</span>)</span></code><button title="Copy to Clipboard" class="code-copy-button"><i class="bi"></i></button></pre></div>
</div>
<p>Throughout this book, you’ll often see me typing in <code>library()</code> commands. You don’t actually have to type them in yourself: you can use the RStudio package panel to do all your package loading for you. The only reason I include the <code>library()</code> commands sometimes is as a reminder to you to make sure that you have the relevant package loaded. Oh, and I suppose we should check to see if our attempt to load the package actually worked. Let’s see if R now knows about the existence of the <code>read.spss()</code> function…</p>

<h3 data-number="6.1.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="packageunload"><span class="header-section-number">6.1.3</span> Unloading a package</h3>
<p>Sometimes, especially after a long session of working with R, you find yourself wanting to get rid of some of those packages that you’ve loaded. The RStudio package panel makes this exactly as easy as loading the package in the first place. Find the entry corresponding to the package you want to unload, and uncheck the box. When you do that for the <code>foreign</code> package, you’ll see this command appear on screen:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb8"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb8-1"><a href="#cb8-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">detach</span>(<span class="st">"package:foreign"</span>, <span class="at">unload=</span><span class="cn">TRUE</span>)</span></code><button title="Copy to Clipboard" class="code-copy-button"><i class="bi"></i></button></pre></div>
</div>
<p>And the package is unloaded. We can verify this by seeing if the <code>read.spss()</code> function still <code>exists()</code>:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb9"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb9-1"><a href="#cb9-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">exists</span>( <span class="st">"read.spss"</span> )</span></code><button title="Copy to Clipboard" class="code-copy-button"><i class="bi"></i></button></pre></div>

<p>Sections @ref(packageload) and @ref(packageunload) cover the main things you need to know about loading and unloading packages. However, there’s a couple of other details that I want to draw your attention to. A concrete example is the best way to illustrate. One of the other packages that you already have installed on your computer is the <code>Matrix</code> package, so let’s load that one and see what happens:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb11"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb11-1"><a href="#cb11-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">library</span>( Matrix )</span>
<span id="cb11-2"><a href="#cb11-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb11-3"><a href="#cb11-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="do">## Loading required package: lattice</span></span></code><button title="Copy to Clipboard" class="code-copy-button"><i class="bi"></i></button></pre></div>
</div>
<p>This is slightly more complex than the output that we got last time, but it’s not too complicated. The <code>Matrix</code> package makes use of some of the tools in the <code>lattice</code> package, and R has kept track of this dependency. So when you try to load the <code>Matrix</code> package, R recognises that you’re also going to need to have the <code>lattice</code> package loaded too. As a consequence, <em>both</em> packages get loaded, and R prints out a helpful little note on screen to tell you that it’s done so.</p>
<p>R is pretty aggressive about enforcing these dependencies. Suppose, for example, I try to unload the <code>lattice</code> package while the <code>Matrix</code> package is still loaded. This is easy enough to try: all I have to do is uncheck the box next to “lattice” in the packages panel. But if I try this, here’s what happens:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb12"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb12-1"><a href="#cb12-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">detach</span>(<span class="st">"package:lattice"</span>, <span class="at">unload=</span><span class="cn">TRUE</span>)</span>
<span id="cb12-2"><a href="#cb12-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb12-3"><a href="#cb12-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="do">## Error: package `lattice' is required by `Matrix' so will not be detached</span></span></code><button title="Copy to Clipboard" class="code-copy-button"><i class="bi"></i></button></pre></div>
</div>
<p>R refuses to do it. This can be quite useful, since it stops you from accidentally removing something that you still need. So, if I want to remove both <code>Matrix</code> and <code>lattice</code>, I need to do it in the correct order</p>
<p>Something else you should be aware of. Sometimes you’ll attempt to load a package, and R will print out a message on screen telling you that something or other has been “masked”. This will be confusing to you if I don’t explain it now, and it actually ties very closely to the whole reason why R forces you to load packages separately from installing them. Here’s an example. Two of the package that I’ll refer to a lot in this book are called <code>car</code> and <code>psych</code>. The <code>car</code> package is short for “Companion to Applied Regression” (which is a really great book, I’ll add), and it has a lot of tools that I’m quite fond of. The <code>car</code> package was written by a guy called John Fox, who has written a lot of great statistical tools for social science applications. The <code>psych</code> package was written by William Revelle, and it has a lot of functions that are very useful for psychologists in particular, especially in regards to psychometric techniques. For the most part, <code>car</code> and <code>psych</code> are quite unrelated to each other. They do different things, so not surprisingly almost all of the function names are different. But… there’s one exception to that. The <code>car</code> package and the <code>psych</code> package <em>both</em> contain a function called <code>logit()</code>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> This creates a naming conflict. If I load both packages into R, an ambiguity is created. If the user types in <code>logit(100)</code>, should R use the <code>logit()</code> function in the <code>car</code> package, or the one in the <code>psych</code> package? The answer is: R uses whichever package you loaded most recently, and it tells you this very explicitly. Here’s what happens when I load the <code>car</code> package, and then afterwards load the <code>psych</code> package:</p>

</div>
<p>The output here is telling you that the <code>logit</code> object (i.e., function) in the <code>car</code> package is no longer accessible to you.

<h3 data-number="6.1.5" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="downloading-new-packages"><span class="header-section-number">6.1.5</span> Downloading new packages</h3>
<p>One of the main selling points for R is that there are thousands of packages that have been written for it, and these are all available online. So whereabouts online are these packages to be found, and how do we download and install them? There is a big repository of packages called the “Comprehensive R Archive Network” (CRAN), and the easiest way of getting and installing a new package is from one of the many CRAN mirror sites. Conveniently for us, R provides a function called <code>install.packages()</code> that you can use to do this. Even <em>more</em> conveniently, the RStudio team runs its own CRAN mirror and RStudio has a clean interface that lets you install packages without having to learn how to use the <code>install.packages()</code> command<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>Using the RStudio tools is, again, dead simple. In the top left hand corner of the packages panel (Figure @ref(fig:packagepanel)) you’ll see a button called “Install Packages”. If you click on that, it will bring up a window like the one shown in Figure @ref(fig:packageinstalla).</p>
<div class="cell">

</div>
<p>There are a few different buttons and boxes you can play with. Ignore most of them. Just go to the line that says “Packages” and start typing the name of the package that you want. As you type, you’ll see a dropdown menu appear (Figure @ref(fig:packageinstallb)), listing names of packages that start with the letters that you’ve typed so far.</p>
<div class="cell">

</div>
<p>You can select from this list, or just keep typing. Either way, once you’ve got the package name that you want, click on the install button at the bottom of the window. When you do, you’ll see the following command appear in the R console:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb18"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb18-1"><a href="#cb18-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">install.packages</span>(<span class="st">"psych"</span>)</span></code><button title="Copy to Clipboard" class="code-copy-button"><i class="bi"></i></button></pre></div>
</div>
<p>This is the R command that does all the work. R then goes off to the internet, has a conversation with CRAN, downloads some stuff, and installs it on your computer. You probably don’t care about all the details of R’s little adventure on the web, but the <code>install.packages()</code> function is rather chatty, so it reports a bunch of gibberish that you really aren’t all that interested in:</p>

<p>Despite the long and tedious response, all thar really means is “I’ve installed the psych package”. I find it best to humour the talkative little automaton. I don’t actually read any of this garbage, I just politely say “thanks” and go back to whatever I was doing.</p>

<p>Every now and then the authors of packages release updated versions. The updated versions often add new functionality, fix bugs, and so on. It’s generally a good idea to update your packages periodically. There’s an <code>update.packages()</code> function that you can use to do this, but it’s probably easier to stick with the RStudio tool. In the packages panel, click on the “Update Packages” button. This will bring up a window that looks like the one shown in Figure @ref(fig:updatepackages). In this window, each row refers to a package that needs to be updated. You can to tell R which updates you want to install by checking the boxes on the left. If you’re feeling lazy and just want to update everything, click the “Select All” button, and then click the “Install Updates” button. R then prints out a <em>lot</em> of garbage on the screen, individually downloading and installing all the new packages. This might take a while to complete depending on how good your internet connection is. Go make a cup of coffee. Come back, and all will be well.</p>
<div class="cell">

</div>
<p>About every six months or so, a new version of R is released. You can’t update R from within RStudio (not to my knowledge, at least): to get the new version you can go to the CRAN website and download the most recent version of R, and install it in the same way you did when you originally installed R on your computer. This used to be a slightly frustrating event, because whenever you downloaded the new version of R, you would lose all the packages that you’d downloaded and installed, and would have to repeat the process of re-installing them. This was pretty annoying, and there were some neat tricks you could use to get around this. However, newer versions of R don’t have this problem so I no longer bother explaining the workarounds for that issue.</p>

<h3 data-number="6.1.7" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-packages-does-this-book-use"><span class="header-section-number">6.1.7</span> What packages does this book use?</h3>
<p>There are several packages that I make use of in this book. The most prominent ones are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>lsr</code>. This is the <em>Learning Statistics with R</em> package that accompanies this book. It doesn’t have a lot of interesting high-powered tools: it’s just a small collection of handy little things that I think can be useful to novice users. As you get more comfortable with R this package should start to feel pretty useless to you.</li>
<li><code>psych</code>. This package, written by William Revelle, includes a lot of tools that are of particular use to psychologists. In particular, there’s several functions that are particularly convenient for producing analyses or summaries that are very common in psych, but less common in other disciplines.</li>
<li><code>car</code>. This is the <em>Companion to Applied Regression</em> package, which accompanies the excellent book of the same name by <span class="citation" data-cites="Fox2011">(<a href="references.html#ref-Fox2011" role="doc-biblioref">Fox and Weisberg 2011</a>)</span>. It provides a lot of very powerful tools, only some of which we’ll touch in this book.</li>
</ul>
<p>Besides these three, there are a number of packages that I use in a more limited fashion: <code>gplots</code>, <code>sciplot</code>, <code>foreign</code>, <code>effects</code>, <code>R.matlab</code>, <code>gdata</code>, <code>lmtest</code>, and probably one or two others that I’ve missed. There are also a number of packages that I refer to but don’t actually use in this book, such as <code>reshape</code>, <code>compute.es</code>, <code>HistData</code> and <code>multcomp</code> among others. Finally, there are a number of packages that provide more advanced tools that I hope to talk about in future versions of the book, such as <code>sem</code>, <code>ez</code>, <code>nlme</code> and <code>lme4</code>. In any case, whenever I’m using a function that isn’t in the core packages, I’ll make sure to note this in the text.</p>

<h2 data-number="6.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="navigation"><span class="header-section-number">6.2</span> Navigating the file system</h2>
<p>In this section I talk a little about how R interacts with the file system on your computer. It’s not a terribly interesting topic, but it’s useful. As background to this discussion, I’ll talk a bit about how file system locations work in Section @ref(filesystem). Once upon a time <em>everyone</em> who used computers could safely be assumed to understand how the file system worked, because it was impossible to successfully use a computer if you didn’t! However, modern operating systems are much more “user friendly”, and as a consequence of this they go to great lengths to hide the file system from users. So these days it’s not at all uncommon for people to have used computers most of their life and not be familiar with the way that computers organise files. If you already know this stuff, skip straight to Section @ref(navigationR). Otherwise, read on. I’ll try to give a brief introduction that will be useful for those of you who have never been forced to learn how to navigate around a computer using a DOS or UNIX shell.</p>
<section id="filesystem" class="level3" data-number="6.2.1">
<h3 data-number="6.2.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="filesystem"><span class="header-section-number">6.2.1</span> The file system itself</h3>
<p>In this section I describe the basic idea behind file locations and file paths. Regardless of whether you’re using Window, Mac OS or Linux, every file on the computer is assigned a (fairly) human readable address, and every address has the same basic structure: it describes a <em>path</em> that starts from a <em>root</em> location , through as series of <em>folders</em> (or if you’re an old-school computer user, <em>directories</em>), and finally ends up at the file.</p>
<p>On a Windows computer the root is the physical drive<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> on which the file is stored, and for most home computers the name of the hard drive that stores all your files is C: and therefore most file names on Windows begin with C:. After that comes the folders, and on Windows the folder names are separated by a <code>\</code> symbol. So, the complete path to this book on my Windows computer might be something like this:</p>
<pre><code>C:\Users\danRbook\LSR.pdf</code></pre>
<p>and what that <em>means</em> is that the book is called LSR.pdf, and it’s in a folder called <code>book</code> which itself is in a folder called dan which itself is … well, you get the idea. On Linux, Unix and Mac OS systems, the addresses look a little different, but they’re more or less identical in spirit. Instead of using the backslash, folders are separated using a forward slash, and unlike Windows, they don’t treat the physical drive as being the root of the file system. So, the path to this book on my Mac might be something like this:</p>
<pre><code>/Users/dan/Rbook/LSR.pdf</code></pre>
<p>So that’s what we mean by the “path” to a file. The next concept to grasp is the idea of a <strong><em>working directory</em></strong> and how to change it. For those of you who have used command line interfaces previously, this should be obvious already. But if not, here’s what I mean. The working directory is just “whatever folder I’m currently looking at”. Suppose that I’m currently looking for files in Explorer (if you’re using Windows) or using Finder (on a Mac). The folder I currently have open is my user directory (i.e., <code>C:\Users\dan</code> or <code>/Users/dan</code>). That’s my current working directory.</p>
<p>The fact that we can imagine that the program is “in” a particular directory means that we can talk about moving <em>from</em> our current location <em>to</em> a new one. What that means is that we might want to specify a new location in relation to our current location. To do so, we need to introduce two new conventions. Regardless of what operating system you’re using, we use <code>.</code> to refer to the current working directory, and <code>..</code> to refer to the directory above it. This allows us to specify a path to a new location in relation to our current location, as the following examples illustrate. Let’s assume that I’m using my Windows computer, and my working directory is <code>C:\Users\danRbook</code>). The table below shows several addresses in relation to my current one:</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>There’s one last thing I want to call attention to: the <code>~</code> directory. I normally wouldn’t bother, but R makes reference to this concept sometimes. It’s quite common on computers that have multiple users to define <code>~</code> to be the user’s home directory. On my Mac, for instance, the home directory <code>~</code> for the “dan” user is <code>\Users\dan\</code>. And so, not surprisingly, it is possible to define other directories in terms of their relationship to the home directory. For example, an alternative way to describe the location of the <code>LSR.pdf</code> file on my Mac would be</p>
<pre><code>~Rbook\LSR.pdf</code></pre>
<p>That’s about all you really need to know about file paths. And since this section already feels too long, it’s time to look at how to navigate the file system in R.</p>
</section>
<section id="navigationR" class="level3" data-number="6.2.2">
<h3 data-number="6.2.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="navigationR"><span class="header-section-number">6.2.2</span> Navigating the file system using the R console</h3>
<p>In this section I’ll talk about how to navigate this file system from within R itself. It’s not particularly user friendly, and so you’ll probably be happy to know that RStudio provides you with an easier method, and I will describe it in Section @ref(nav3). So in practice, you won’t <em>really</em> need to use the commands that I babble on about in this section, but I do think it helps to see them in operation at least once before forgetting about them forever.</p>
<p>Okay, let’s get started. When you want to load or save a file in R it’s important to know what the working directory is. You can find out by using the <code>getwd()</code> command. For the moment, let’s assume that I’m using Mac OS or Linux, since there’s some subtleties to Windows. Here’s what happens:</p>
<pre><code>getwd()
## [1] "/Users/dan"</code></pre>
<p>We can change the working directory quite easily using <code>setwd()</code>. The <code>setwd()</code> function has only the one argument, <code>dir</code>, is a character string specifying a path to a directory, or a path relative to the working directory. Since I’m currently located at <code>/Users/dan</code>, the following two are equivalent:</p>
<pre><code>setwd("/Users/dan/Rbook/data")
setwd("./Rbook/data")</code></pre>
<p>Now that we’re here, we can type <code>list.files()</code> command to get a listing of all the files in that directory. Since this is the directory in which I store all of the data files that we’ll use in this book, here’s what we get as the result:</p>
<pre><code>list.files()
## [1] "afl24.Rdata"             "aflsmall.Rdata"          "aflsmall2.Rdata"

<p>Not terribly exciting, I’ll admit, but it’s useful to know about. In any case, there’s only one more thing I want to make a note of, which is that R also makes use of the home directory. You can find out what it is by using the <code>path.expand()</code> function, like this:</p>
<pre><code>path.expand("~")
## [1] "/Users/dan"</code></pre>
<p>You can change the user directory if you want, but we’re not going to make use of it very much so there’s no reason to. The only reason I’m even bothering to mention it at all is that when you use RStudio to open a file, you’ll see output on screen that defines the path to the file relative to the <code>~</code> directory. I’d prefer you not to be confused when you see it.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

<p>Let’s suppose I’m on Windows. As before, I can find out what my current working directory is like this:</p>
<pre><code>getwd()
## [1] "C:/Users/dan/</code></pre>
<p>This seems about right, but you might be wondering why R is displaying a Windows path using the wrong type of slash. The answer is slightly complicated, and has to do with the fact that R treats the <code>\</code> character as “special” (see Section @ref(escapechars)). If you’re deeply wedded to the idea of specifying a path using the Windows style slashes, then what you need to do is to type <code>/</code> whenever you mean <code>\</code>. In other words, if you want to specify the working directory on a Windows computer, you need to use one of the following commands:</p>
<pre><code>setwd( "C:/Users/dan" )
setwd( "C:\\Users\\dan" )</code></pre>
<p>It’s kind of annoying to have to do it this way, but as you’ll see later on in Section @ref(escapechars) it’s a necessary evil. Fortunately, as we’ll see in the next section, RStudio provides a much simpler way of changing directories…</p>

<h3 data-number="6.2.4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="nav3"><span class="header-section-number">6.2.4</span> Navigating the file system using the RStudio file panel</h3>
<p>Although I think it’s important to understand how all this command line stuff works, in many (maybe even most) situations there’s an easier way. For our purposes, the easiest way to navigate the file system is to make use of RStudio’s built in tools. The “file” panel – the lower right hand area in Figure @ref(fig:filepanel) – is actually a pretty decent file browser. Not only can you just point and click on the names to move around the file system, you can also use it to set the working directory, and even load files.</p>
<div class="cell">

</div>
<p>Here’s what you need to do to change the working directory using the file panel. Let’s say I’m looking at the actual screen shown in Figure @ref(fig:filepanel). At the top of the file panel you see some text that says “Home <span class="math inline">\(&gt;\)</span> Rbook <span class="math inline">\(&gt;\)</span> data”. What that means is that it’s <em>displaying</em> the files that are stored in the</p>
<pre><code>/Users/dan/Rbook/data</code></pre>
<p>directory on my computer. It does <em>not</em> mean that this is the R working directory. If you want to change the R working directory, using the file panel, you need to click on the button that reads “More”. This will bring up a little menu, and one of the options will be “Set as Working Directory”. If you select that option, then R really will change the working directory. You can tell that it has done so because this command appears in the console:</p>
<pre><code>setwd("~/Rbook/data")</code></pre>
<p>In other words, RStudio sends a command to the R console, exactly as if you’d typed it yourself. The file panel can be used to do other things too. If you want to move “up” to the parent folder (e.g., from <code>/Users/dan/Rbook/data</code> to <code>/Users/dan/Rbook</code> click on the “..” link in the file panel. To move to a subfolder, click on the name of the folder that you want to open. You can open some types of file by clicking on them. You can delete files from your computer using the “delete” button, rename them with the “rename” button, and so on.</p>
<p>As you can tell, the file panel is a very handy little tool for navigating the file system. But it can do more than just navigate. As we’ll see later, it can be used to open files. And if you look at the buttons and menu options that it presents, you can even use it to rename, delete, copy or move files, and create new folders. However, since most of that functionality isn’t critical to the basic goals of this book, I’ll let you discover those on your own.</p>

<li id="fn2"><p>Basically, the reason is that there are 5000 packages, and probably about 4000 authors of packages, and no-one really knows what all of them do. Keeping the installation separate from the loading minimizes the chances that two packages will interact with each other in a nasty way.<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn3"><p>If you’re using the command line, you can get the same information by typing <code>library()</code> at the command line.<a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

<li id="fn5"><p>Tip for advanced users. You can get R to use the one from the <code>car</code> package by using <code>car::logit()</code> as your command rather than <code>logit()</code>, since the <code>car::</code> part tells R explicitly which package to use. See also <code>:::</code> if you’re especially keen to force R to use functions it otherwise wouldn’t, but take care, since <code>:::</code> can be dangerous.<a href="#fnref5" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn6"><p>It is not very difficult.<a href="#fnref6" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn7"><p>Well, the partition, technically.<a href="#fnref7" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn8"><p>One additional thing worth calling your attention to is the <code>file.choose()</code> function. Suppose you want to load a file and you don’t quite remember where it is, but would like to browse for it. Typing <code>file.choose()</code> at the command line will open a window in which you can browse to find the file; when you click on the file you want, R will print out the full path to that file. This is kind of handy.<a href="#fnref8" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
