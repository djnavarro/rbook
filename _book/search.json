    "text": "Welcome!\nYou’ve discovered the work-in-progress revision for “Learning Statistics with R”.\nI’m so sorry.\nPerhaps I should explain. Back in the grimdark pre-Snapchat era of humanity (i.e. early 2011), I started teaching an introductory statistics class for psychology students offered at the University of Adelaide, using the R statistical package as the primary tool. I wrote my own lecture notes for the class, which have now expanded to the point of effectively being a book. The book is freely available, and released under a creative commons licence (CC BY-SA 4.0). Somehow the book turned out to be rather popular and there are now several variations of the original LSR book:\n\nMy original book was written in LaTeX, which makes it a little inaccessible. Emily Kothe kindly created a bookdown adaptation of LSR, which I’m now reworking in quarto\nMatt Crump has incorporated some LSR content in Answering Questions with Data\nMy own R programming notes R for Psychological Science adapt some LSR content\nDavid Foxcroft has adapted LSR to create Learning Statistics with Jamovi\nTom Faulkenberry has adapted David Foxcroft’s version to create Learning Statistics with JASP\nJean-Marc Meunier has translated Learning Statistics with Jamovi into French\nEthan Weed has started work on a Learning Statistics with Python adaptation (this is a work in progress!)\nRóbert Fodor is working on Learning Statistics with Cogstat\n\nI have suggested that someone write a Learning Statistics with an Abacus adaptation but so far there has been little interest."
