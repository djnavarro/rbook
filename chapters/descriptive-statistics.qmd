Any time that you get a new data set to look at, one of the first tasks that you have to do is find ways of summarising the data in a compact, easily understood fashion. This is what **descriptive statistics** (as opposed to inferential statistics) is all about. In fact, to many people the term "statistics" is synonymous with descriptive statistics. It is this topic that we'll consider in this chapter, but before going into any details, let's take a moment to get a sense of why we need descriptive statistics. To get started, let's take a look at the `southern_slam` data that is bundled as part of the lsrbook package:

```{r}
library(tibble)
library(lsrbook)
southern_slam
```

The `southern_slam` data set contains the results from 43 roller derby bouts that took place as part of the 2022 "Great Southern Slam" tournament held in Adelaide, Australia. I'll talk more about this data set later, but for now it's enough to note that we have columns specifying the names of the `home_team` and the `visitor_team`, columns storing the `home_score` and `visitor_score`, and another column called `margin` that contains the winning margin for each game. 

Let's have a look at the `margins` variable:

```{r}
southern_slam$margin
```

This output doesn't make it easy to get a sense of what the data are actually saying. Just "looking at the data" isn't a terribly effective way of understanding data. In order to get some idea about what's going on, we need to calculate some descriptive statistics (this chapter) and draw some nice pictures (Chapter \@ref(graphics). Since the descriptive statistics are the easier of the two topics, I'll start with those, but nevertheless I'll show you a histogram of the `southern_slam$margin` data, since it should help you get a sense of what the data we're trying to describe actually look like. We'll talk a lot more about how to draw histograms in Section \@ref(hist). For now, it's enough to look at the histogram and note that it provides a fairly interpretable representation of the margins data.

```{r}
#| label: southern_slam_margins
#| echo: false
ggplot2::ggplot(southern_slam, ggplot2::aes(margin)) +
	ggplot2::geom_histogram(breaks = seq(0, 600, 50)) + 
	ggplot2::labs(
		x = "Winning Margin",
		y = "Count"
	)
```

## Measures of central tendency {#centraltendency}

Drawing pictures of the data is an excellent way to convey the "gist" of what the data is trying to tell you. Another approach that can be helpful is to condense the data into a few simple "summary" statistics. In most situations, the first thing that you'll want to calculate is a measure of **central tendency**. That is, you'd like to know something about the "average" or "middle" of your data lies. The two most commonly used measures are the mean, median and mode; occasionally people will also report a trimmed mean. I'll explain each of these in turn, and then discuss when each of them is useful.

### The mean {#mean}

The **mean** of a set of observations is just a normal, old-fashioned average: add all of the values up, and then divide by the total number of values. The first five winning margins in the `southern_slam` data are 196, 51, 23, 106 and 219, so the mean of these observations is just:
$$
\frac{196 + 51 + 23 + 106 + 219}{5} = \frac{595}{5} = 119
$$
Of course, this definition of the mean isn't news to anyone: averages (i.e., means) are used so often in everyday life that this is pretty familiar stuff. However, since the concept of a mean is something that everyone already understands, I'll use this as an excuse to start introducing some of the mathematical notation that statisticians use to describe this calculation, and talk about how the calculations would be done in R. 

The first piece of notation to introduce is $N$, which we'll use to refer to the number of observations that we're averaging (in this case $N = 5$). Next, we need to attach a label to the observations themselves. It's traditional to use $X$ for this, and to use subscripts to indicate which observation we're actually talking about. That is, we'll use $X_1$ to refer to the first observation, $X_2$ to refer to the second observation, and so on, all the way up to $X_N$ for the last one. Or, to say the same thing in a slightly more abstract way, we use $X_i$ to refer to the $i$-th observation. Just to make sure we're clear on the notation, the following table lists the 5 observations in the `southern_slam$margins` variable, along with the mathematical symbol used to refer to it, and the actual value that the observation corresponds to:

| The observation        | Its symbol | The observed value |
|:-----------------------|:----------:|-------------------:|
| Winning margin, game 1 | $X_1$      |         196 points |
| Winning margin, game 2 | $X_2$      |          51 points |
| Winning margin, game 3 | $X_3$      |          23 points |
| Winning margin, game 4 | $X_4$      |         106 points |
| Winning margin, game 5 | $X_5$      |         219 points |


Okay, now let's try to write a formula for the mean. By tradition, we use $\bar{X}$ as the notation for the mean. So the calculation for the mean could be expressed using the following formula:
$$
\bar{X} = \frac{X_1 + X_2 + ... + X_{N-1} + X_N}{N}
$$
This formula is entirely correct, but it's terribly long, so we use a **summation symbol** -- written as $sum$ -- to shorten it.^[The choice to use $\sum$ to denote summation isn't entirely arbitrary. It's essentially identical the Greek upper case letter sigma, which is the analogue of the letter S. I do realise that "S is for sum" is a bit silly, but life is like that I'm afraid. Mathematical fonts will usually have some subtle differences between the summation symbol $\sum$ and the upper case sigma $\displaystyle\Sigma$, but as you can see those differences are minor. Along similar lines, there's a "product" symbol $\prod$ used to denote the multiplication of lots of numbers, and it very closely resembles the upper case Greek letter pi (the Greek analog of P). Again, there are usually minor differences in how they look in a font: $\prod$ is a product symbol, whereas $\displaystyle\Pi$ is the upper case pi... and oh my god this footnote is boring.] If I want to add up the first five observations, I could write out the sum the long way, $X_1 + X_2 + X_3 + X_4 +X_5$ or I could use the summation symbol to shorten it to this:
$$
\sum_{i=1}^5 X_i
$$
Taken literally, this could be read as "the sum, taken over all $i$ values from 1 to 5, of the value $X_i$". But basically, what it means is "add up the first five observations". In any case, we can use this notation to write out the formula for the mean, which looks like this:
$$
\bar{X} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N X_i 
$$

In all honesty, I can't imagine that all this mathematical notation helps clarify the concept of the mean at all. In fact, it's really just a fancy way of writing out the same thing I said in words: add all the values up, and then divide by the total number of items. However, that's not really the reason I went into all that detail. My goal was to try to make sure that everyone reading this book is clear on the notation that we'll be using throughout the book: $\bar{X}$ for the mean, $\scriptstyle\sum$ for the idea of summation, $X_i$ for the $i$th observation, and $N$ for the total number of observations. We're going to be re-using these symbols a fair bit, so it's important that you understand them well enough to be able to "read" the equations, and to be able to see that it's just saying "add up lots of things and then divide by another thing".

### Calculating the mean in R

Okay that's the maths, how do we get the magic computing box to do the work for us? If you really wanted to, you could do this calculation directly in R. For the first `southern_slam` games, do this just by typing it in as if R were a calculator...

```{r}
(196 + 51 + 23 + 106 + 219) / 5
```

... in which case R outputs the answer `r sum(southern_slam$margin[1:5])`, just as if it were a calculator. However, that's not the only way to do the calculations, and when the number of observations starts to become large, it's easily the most tedious. Besides, in almost every real world scenario, you've already got the actual numbers stored in a variable of some kind, just like we have with the `afl.margins` variable. Under those circumstances, what you want is a function that will just add up all the values stored in a numeric vector. That's what the `sum()` function does. If we want to add up all `r nrow(southern_slam)` winning margins in the data set, we can do so using the following command:^[Note that, just as we saw with the combine function `c()` and the remove function `rm()`, the `sum()` function has unnamed arguments. I'll talk about unnamed arguments later in Section \@ref(dotsargument), but for now let's just ignore this detail.]

```{r}
sum(southern_slam$margin)
```

If we only want the sum of the first five observations, then we can use square brackets to pull out only the first five elements of the vector. So the command would now be: 

```{r}
sum(southern_slam$margin[1:5])
```

To calculate the mean, we now tell R to divide the output of this summation by five, so the command that we need to type now becomes the following:

```{r}
sum(southern_slam$margin[1:5]) / 5
```

Although it's pretty easy to calculate the mean using the `sum()` function, we can do it in an even easier way, since R also provides us with the `mean()` function. To calculate the mean for all 176 games, we would use the following command:

```{r}
mean(southern_slam$margin[1:5])
```

As you can see, this gives exactly the same answers as the previous calculations.

### The median {#median}

The second measure of central tendency that people use a lot is the **median**, and it's even easier to describe than the mean. The median of a set of observations is just the middle value. As before let's imagine we were interested only in the first five winning margins: 196, 51, 23, 106, and 219. To figure out the median, we sort these numbers into ascending order:

$$
23, 51, \mathbf{106}, 196, 219
$$

From inspection, it's obvious that the median value of these five observations is `r median(southern_slam$margin[1:5])`, since that's the middle one in the sorted list (I've put it in bold to make it even more obvious). Easy stuff. But what should we do if we were interested in the first *six* games rather than the first five? The sixth game in the tournament had a winning margin of 60 points, so our sorted list is now 
$$
23, 51, \mathbf{60}, \mathbf{106}, 196, 219 
$$

and there are *two* middle numbers, `r sort(southern_slam$margin[1:6])[3]` and `r sort(southern_slam$margin[1:6])[4]`. The median is defined as the average of those two numbers, which in this case is `r mean(sort(southern_slam$margin[1:6])[3:4])`. As before, it's very tedious to do this by hand when you've got lots of numbers. To illustrate this, here's what happens when you use R to sort all `r nrow(southern_slam)` winning margins. First, I'll use the `sort()` function (discussed in Chapter \@ref(datahandling)) to display the winning margins in increasing numerical order:

```{r}
sort(southern_slam$margin)
```

As we have `r nrow(southern_slam)` observations in our data, the median value corresponds to item `r (nrow(southern_slam) + 1)/2` in the sorted list of numbers. When we look up that observation in the list, we find that the median winning was `r sort(southern_slam$margin)[(nrow(southern_slam) + 1) / 2]`. In real life, of course, we don't actually calculate the median by sorting the data and then looking for the middle value by searching it manually. In real life, we use the `median()` command:

```{r}
median(southern_slam$margin)
```

Much nicer. 


### Mean or median? What's the difference?


```{r meanmedian, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="An illustration of the difference between how the mean and the median should be interpreted. The mean is basically the \"centre of gravity\" of the data set: if you imagine that the histogram of the data is a solid object, then the point on which you could balance it (as if on a see-saw) is the mean. In contrast, the median is the middle observation. Half of the observations are smaller, and half of the observations are larger."}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "meanmedian.png")
```

Knowing how to calculate means and medians is only a part of the story. You also need to understand what each one is saying about the data, and what that implies for when you should use each one. This is illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:meanmedian) the mean is kind of like the "centre of gravity" of the data set, whereas the median is the "middle value" in the data. What this implies, as far as which one you should use, depends a little on what type of data you've got and what you're trying to achieve. As a rough guide:
 
- If your data are nominal scale, you probably shouldn't be using either the mean or the median. Both the mean and the median rely on the idea that the numbers assigned to values are meaningful. If the numbering scheme is arbitrary, then it's probably best to use the mode (Section \@ref(mode)) instead. 
- If your data are ordinal scale, you're more likely to want to use the median than the mean. The median only makes use of the order information in your data (i.e., which numbers are bigger), but doesn't depend on the precise numbers involved. That's exactly the situation that applies when your data are ordinal scale. The mean, on the other hand, makes use of the precise numeric values assigned to the observations, so it's not really appropriate for ordinal data.
- For interval and ratio scale data, either one is generally acceptable. Which one you pick depends a bit on what you're trying to achieve. The mean has the advantage that it uses all the information in the data (which is useful when you don't have a lot of data), but it's very sensitive to extreme values, as we'll see in Section \@ref(trimmedmean).  

Let's expand on that last part a little. One consequence is that there's systematic differences between the mean and the median when the histogram is asymmetric (skewed; see Section \@ref(skewandkurtosis)). This is illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:meanmedian) notice that the median (right hand side) is located closer to the "body" of the histogram, whereas the mean (left hand side) gets dragged towards the "tail" (where the extreme values are). To give a concrete example, suppose Bob (income \$50,000), Kate (income \$60,000) and Jane (income \$65,000) are sitting at a table: the average income at the table is \$58,333 and the median income is \$60,000. Then Bill sits down with them (income \$100,000,000). The average income has now jumped to \$25,043,750 but the median rises only to \$62,500. If you're interested in looking at the overall income at the table, the mean might be the right answer; but if you're interested in what counts as a typical income at the table, the median would be a better choice here.
